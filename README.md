This was a personal collection of some ideas in computer science, software engineering, and programming. 

This project is paused as of April 2025, as I found fragments of the notes being returned by AI systems without attribution.
All existing content that was previously published here has been stripped.
I do continue to take notes in private, but won't push them to GitHub any longer.

If you have already created a fork, please be so kind to either delete it or set it to private. Thank you.
